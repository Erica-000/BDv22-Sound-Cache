# Brutal Doom v22 Sound Cache

A mod that caches every sound in the game at the start of every level to reduce stutters during gameplay. This mod only works with Brutal Doom v22 and GZDoom.

## Installation ##

Simply download the latest available release and use your favorite doom launcher to load it. Load order doesn't matter as long as it's after Brutal Doom.

## Compatibility ##

Since it doesn't edit any base file, it should be compatible with 99.9% of mods out there. Yes, even mods that replace Brutal Doom's sound effects should work. Mods that add entirely new weapons that use new sounds, or just any new sound effects that don't replace existing ones won't work.
